In the JSON3 package, there are two main interfaces for interacting with these JSON types: 1) builtin and 2) struct mapping. For builtin reading, called like JSON3.read(json_string), the JSON3 package will parse a string or Vector{UInt8}, returning a default object that maps to the type of the JSON. For a JSON Object, it will return a JSON3.Object type, which acts like an immutable Dict, but has a more efficient view representation. For a JSON Array, it will return a JSON3.Array type, which acts like an immutable Vector, but also has a more efficient view representation. If the JSON Array has homogenous elements, the resulting JSON3.Array will be strongly typed accordingly. For the other JSON types (string, number, bool, and null), they are returned as Julia equivalents (String, Int64 or Float64, Bool, and nothing).","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"One might wonder why custom JSON3.Object and JSON3.Array types exist instead of just returning Dict and Vector directly. JSON3 employs a novel technique inspired by the simdjson project, that is a semi-lazy parsing of JSON to the JSON3.Object or JSON3.Array types. The technique involves using a type-less \"tape\" to note the positions of objects, arrays, and strings in a JSON structure, while avoiding the cost of materializing such objects. For \"scalar\" types (number, bool, and null), the values are parsed immediately and stored inline in the \"tape\". This can result in best of both worlds performance: very fast initial parsing of a JSON input, and very cheap access afterwards. It also enables efficiencies in workflows where only small pieces of a JSON structure are needed, because expensive objects, arrays, and strings aren't materialized unless accessed. One additional advantage this technique allows is strong typing of JSON3.Array{T}; because the type of each element is noted while parsing, the JSON3.Array object can then be constructed with the most narrow type possible without having to reallocate any underlying data (since all data is stored in a type-less \"tape\" anyway).","category":"page"},{"location":"","page":"Home","title":"Home","text":"The JSON3.Object supports the AbstactDict interface, but is read-only (it represents a view into the JSON string input), thus it supports obj[:x] and obj[\"x\"], as well as obj.x for accessing fields.

A lot! For data types, the most typical JSON representation is for each field name to be a JSON key, and each field value to be a JSON value.

Yes, the JSON specification says that Objects are specifically un-ordered collections of key-value pairs, but the truth is that many JSON libraries provide ways to maintain JSON Object key-value pair order when reading/writing. Because of the minimal processing done while parsing, and the \"trusting\" that the Julia type constructor will be able to handle fields being present, missing, or even extra fields that should be ignored, this is the fastest possible method for mapping a JSON input to a Julia structure. If your workflow interacts with non-Julia APIs for sending/receiving JSON, you should take care to test and confirm the use of StructTypes.Struct() in the cases mentioned above: what if a field is missing when parsing? what if the key-value pairs are out of order? what if there extra fields get included that weren't anticipated?

If certain fields need to be intialized or zeroed out for security, then this should be accounted for in the inner constructor). For these mutable types, the type will first be initizlied like MyType(), then JSON parsing will parse each key-value pair in a JSON object, setting the field as the key is encountered, and converting the JSON value to the appropriate field value. This flow has the nice properties of: allowing parsing success even if fields are missing in the JSON structure, and if \"extra\" fields exist in the JSON structure that aren't apart of the Julia struct's fields, it will automatically be ignored.
